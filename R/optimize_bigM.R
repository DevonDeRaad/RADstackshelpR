When alleles from the same locus are undermerged, the software will incorrectly consider them as independent loci. When loci are overmerged because they happen to be close in sequence space, an errant locus with false polymorphism will result. Therefore, M is particularly dataset‐specific because it depends on the natural levels of polymorphism in the species, as well as the amount of error generated during the preparation and sequencing of the RAD‐seq libraries.")
